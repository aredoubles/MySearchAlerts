# Twitter Search

I want to use social media APIs to do see what discussion of certain topics/terms is like.

Currently, this script asks for a term, then prints the results in the command line.

Down the line, I want to get alerts, even emails, on a list of custom terms.

Mostly just an excuse to see the social media APIs!


## Social media APIs to explore
- Twitter (done!)
- Instagram (running into issues with documentation, may not return posts anyway, a la Facebook)
- Reddit (in progress!)
- Looks like Facebook's Public Feed API is NOT open to the public anymore, so I won't be searching Facebook at all
- Quora?
- StackExchange and family?
- Others?
